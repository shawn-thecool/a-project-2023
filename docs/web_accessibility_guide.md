# Web Accessibility Guide for Using Monochromatic Colors

1. Use a color palette with a maximum of 12 monochromatic colors. This will provide enough variety while still maintaining a consistent look and feel.

2. Use a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 between text and background colors to ensure readability for people with low vision. This is especially important for body text, headings, and other important content.

3. Avoid using very light or very dark colors as text colors. Light colors on a light background and dark colors on a dark background can be difficult to read.

4. Use different shades of the same color to indicate different types of information or to create hierarchy. For example, you could use a darker shade of gray for headings and a lighter shade for body text.

5. Use monochromatic colors in combination with other design elements such as typography, spacing, and imagery to create visual interest and hierarchy.

6. Be careful when using monochromatic colors in areas such as forms, buttons, and other interactive elements. They must be distinguishable from each other and meet the accessibility standards.

7. Always provide alternative text for images and other non-text content so that people who are using screen readers can understand the context of the images.

8. Use monochromatic colors consistently throughout the website to create a cohesive design.

9. Use a color palette that is consistent with your brand and the overall design of your website.

10. Use tools like color contrast checkers to ensure that your color choices meet accessibility standards.

11. Test your website design with real users, including people with disabilities, to ensure that it is usable and accessible for everyone.

12. Be sure to keep the web accessibility guidelines in mind while designing your website.

  // Expand shorthand form (e.g. "03F") to full form (e.g. "0033FF")
  let shorthandRegex = /^#?([a-f\d])([a-f\d])([a-f\d])$/i;

  let result = /^#?([a-f\d]{2})([a-f\d]{2})([a-f\d]{2})$/i.exec(hex);
  return result
    ? {
        r: parseInt(result[1], 16),
        g: parseInt(result[2], 16),
        b: parseInt(result[3], 16),
      }
    : null;
}

function testContrastRatio(textColor, backgroundColor) {
  // Convert color values to RGB
  let textRGB = hexToRGB(textColor);
  let backgroundRGB = hexToRGB(backgroundColor);

  // Calculate relative luminance for text and background colors
  let textLuminance =
    0.2126 * textRGB.r + 0.7152 * textRGB.g + 0.0722 * textRGB.b;
  let backgroundLuminance =
    0.2126 * backgroundRGB.r +
    0.7152 * backgroundRGB.g +
    0.0722 * backgroundRGB.b;

  // Determine which color has the highest luminance
  let luminance1 = Math.max(textLuminance, backgroundLuminance);
  let luminance2 = Math.min(textLuminance, backgroundLuminance);

  // Calculate contrast ratio
  let contrastRatio = (luminance1 + 0.05) / (luminance2 + 0.05);

  // Return whether or not the contrast ratio meets the minimum threshold
  return contrastRatio >= 4.5;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(testContrastRatio("#000000", "#FFFFFF")); // Returns false
console.log(testContrastRatio("#000000", "#808080")); // Returns true
```
